JRP Tree Visualization
TODO 31 May 2016

- test filtering actions across all 4 dropdowns
- responsive scaling of <svg> element and containing <div>
  - w/reverse
  - pitch
  - rhythm
- on add pitch comparison set -> shrink set A; A & B share screen equally
  - no comparison set for rhythm
- parse RESTful query for w=work,q=root,f=feature-type (pitch || rhythm || ??)
- create setting constraints to maintain legibility (depth, children, count)
  -  depends on comparison set configuration
- alignment styling: invisible nodes if count < min count setting

High-level points for Tasks 1-9 in Section II:
1a  - complete; effective limit of tree depth depends on screen size
1b  - complete
1c  - out of scope: depends on API extension (pitch+rhythm, per note)
      - Craig will add this, given correct code structure (kg will do that)

2a  - complete
2b  - complete
2c  - filter by voice complete, not "no. voices"
2d  - what is 'mode'?
2e  - filtering by mensuration would not result in tree?

3a  - out of scope: requires 1(c)
3b  - ditto

4   - complete

5   - complete (click note to make it new root;
        shift-click to make it and its parent(s) the root)

6   - complete

7   - out of scope: depends on new ribbon tool

8   - in progress;
      RESTful query for w=work,q=root,f=feature-type (pitch || rhythm || ??)

9   - out of scope: requires 1(c)
